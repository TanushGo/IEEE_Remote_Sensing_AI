        Loads the fcn_resnet101 model from torch hub,
        then replaces the first and last layer of the network
        in order to adapt it to our current problem, 
        the first convolution of the fcn_resnet must be changed
        to an input_channels -> 64 Conv2d with (7,7) kernel size,
        (2,2) stride, (3,3) padding and no bias.

        The last layer must be changed to be a 512 -> output_channels
        conv2d layer, with (1,1) kernel size and (1,1) stride. 

        A final pooling layer must then be added to pool each 50x50
        patch down to a 1x1 image, as the original FCN resnet is trained to
        have the segmentation be the same resolution as the input.
        
        Input:
            input_channels: number of input channels of the image
            of shape (batch, input_channels, width, height)
            output_channels: number of output channels of prediction,
            prediction is shape (batch, output_channels, width//scale_factor, height//scale_factor)
            scale_factor: number of input pixels that map to 1 output pixel,
            for example, if the input is 800x800 and the output is 16x6
            then the scale factor is 800/16 = 50.
